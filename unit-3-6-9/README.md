# Task: launching autotests for different interface languages

### Condition: ###
>- Create a GitHub repository where the files will be stored conftest.py and test_items.py.</br>
>- Add to the file conftest.py a handler that reads the language parameter from the command line.</br>
>- Web page structure</br>
>- Implement in the file conftest.py the logic of launching the browser with the specified user language. The browser must be declared in the browser fixture and passed to the test as a parameter.</br>
>- To the test_items file.py write a test that verifies that the product page on the site contains an add to cart button. For example, you can check the product available at http://selenium1py.pythonanywhere.com/catalogue/coders-at-work_207/.</br>
>- The test should be run with the language parameter with the following command: `pytest --language=es test_items.py` and pass successfully. It is enough that the code works only for the Chome browser.
